        I chose to major in Computer Science because I’m passionate about full stack development—building everything from the front-end user experience to the back-end systems that make it all work. 
        My minor in Electrical Engineering allows me to explore robotics and embedded systems, areas where hardware meets software in fascinating ways. 
        I’m also diving into Digital Arts and Sciences, focusing on Game Development to blend my technical skills with my love for gaming. 
        Being a Hispanic Scholarship Fund Scholar has been a great source of pride and motivation as I pursue these diverse interests.
